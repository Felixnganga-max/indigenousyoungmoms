        "The Yaaku tribe traditionally lived in rock caves and stick-thatched houses in Mukogodo Forest.

The forest was and still is the main source of their livelihoods, and contains sacred sites used for religious and traditional practices.",
    },

    },
    {
      question: "What conservation efforts are being made for Mukogodo Forest?",
      answer:

IYM works on climate change initiatives including kitchen gardening projects, carbon bed projects, and agroforestry programs to protect this ancestral land.",
    },
    {
